# Brain---Solution-Challenge
in the first part of the code, 
the signals coming from the sensor are linked to the code (raw signal), 
the sensor has been linked to the code through the thinkgear library.
he signals are read and filtered at this stage to be ready for the second process,
which is extracting Features and the data is saved in Excel sheet after that,
And in order to be sure of the Features we need, 
the function of the second part of the code was to draw the signals to verify them, 
by means of a plot function that calls the data from the Excel sheet that was saved in the previous step, 
and the final data is saved in the Excel sheet after plotting it.
